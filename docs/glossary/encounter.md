These indicators can include orange circles or lines on the ground, markers above player or enemy heads, or any other visual cue that signals an impending action. In more challenging content like Ultimates, some mechanics may not telegraph, necessitating players to rely on other cues such as cast bars.</td>
    </tr>

        <td>"Point-Blank Area-of-Effect" typically denotes an enemy ability that generates a significant AoE damage area centered directly on the enemy itself.</td>

    <tr>
        <th>Enums</th>
